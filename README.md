Memory Game
==========

Project initially has been created to **learn basics of Java**. However recently I have decided to **refactor it**. Code became legacy, but helped me with begining my IT career.

Project is just a famous game, memory. Frequently speaking, it is a card game in which all of the cards are laid face down on a surface and two cards are flipped face up over each turn. The object of the game is to turn over pairs of matching cards. That's all.

After first iteration, code was just a mess. UI was tangled with game logic. But it was working! Code was created according to the idea, "to learn how to program, just program". But nowadays it looks terrible. It shows me how much I have learnt since writing last line of code for this repository.
